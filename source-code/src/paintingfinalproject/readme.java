 * I am Sailik Kundu, now hopefully an emeritus student of Mr Smith.

So what does this java application do?
Many things of course.

- It can open! Please run it by right clicking on the main file
- Try and drag your cursor around on the white space, you'll see sinuous lines wherever you draw
- You can clear anything that you draw by pressing the "Clear" button on the bottom right of the window!
- Where it says "Goatfur handmade brush" (which I did not name so in order to extend the combo box area as
 a result of being lazy), 
click!
- Pick a shape! Well any of the ones displayed as options anyway!
- Start dragging from a point on the screen to a point where you want to shape to end, 
and voila! It should give you the appropriate shape!
- You can also fill in things! Select the fill tool and click (not drag) on an enclosure, made either by brush or shapes!
- To change your color, click on the "Pick Colour" button on the top right! Try filling and drawing with that new colour now!
- To make your strokes bigger or smaller, click on the combo box that says "Medium" and select what size you want to draw with!
This should affect both the strokes of the brush and the sides of the drawn shapes!

Opening...
- Click on the button that says "Open image..."
- It should pop up a JFileChooser.
- It has filters! Navigate to a place with various images and use the filters to change the types of images you see to either:
GIFs, PNGs or JPGs(Apparently SVG type images also work).
- Click on the file you want to open - and click open on the file chooser!
- Viola! The part of the image able to be loaded in the canvas has been loaded! Feel free to do stuff on it.

Saving...
- Click on the button that says "Save image..."
- It should pop up a JFileChooser.
- It has filters, same as that of open image.
- Type a name for the file
IMPORTANT: After you enter the name of the file, add the extension you want it to be saved as, 
 otherwise it is saved as a default "FILE" type. For the things I have tried, only .gif, .png and .jpg work.

That wraps it up. You could learn Japanese after this. My application does not help with that.

Note to Mr Smith:
So I suppose this is goodbye for this semester,  it's been nice. 
* I have known you for three years, and you seem to be rather awesome, 
* speaking from the way I have seen you act and do things. 
* It seems to me that you know French, more trivia than most people in the school and have a sense of humour 
* better than most. You aid all your students who ask for help... the bulk of which was probably diverted to me.
* Thank you for putting up with all of us, and thank you for trying to understand our points of view. 
* You are magnanimous as well as a fair arbiter of help during tests...a lot of which I have also garnered. 
* Thank you being with me through it all.
* I don't know where I will go from here, but thank you very much for all you have taught me.
